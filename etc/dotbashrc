  "Dream big and dare to fail"  
   -- Norman Vaughan

	Norman Vaughan was born on December 19, 1905, in Salem, Massachusetts,
	as the son of a wealthy leather tanner and shoe manufacturer.

	In his youth, he became fascinated by tales of early-century polar
	explorers. He dropped out of Harvard in 1928 when he heard that
	Admiral Richard E. Byrd was organizing an expedition to Antarctica.
	Admiral Byrd accepted him on the 1928â€“1930 expedition, eventually
	naming a mountain on the continent in his honor. 
	In 1994, at the age of 88, Vaughan participated in an expedition
	to climb the 10,302 ft (3,150 m) Mount Vaughan. 

	In 1932, he competed in the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New
	York, in the sprint mushing demonstration sport.

	During World War II, Vaughan was employed by U.S. Army Air Forces
	Search and Rescue as a dogsled driver, attaining the rank of
	colonel and engaging in many rescue missions in Greenland. 

	Norman Vaughan moved to Alaska at the age of 68. Bankrupt and
	divorced, he rebuilt his life, competing in 13 Iditarod races and
	"crashing" the Presidential Inauguration parade in 1977, bringing
	sled dogs to represent his adopted state. In 1981 and 1985, he
	and his Alaskan contingent formally participated in the parade.
	He also had a mountain named after him in the Antarctic.

	He is survived by his fourth wife, the former Carolyn Muegge, who
	has also raced in the Iditarod, and a son and daughter from his
	earlier marriages. On the celebration of his 100th birthday on
	December 18, 2005, surrounded by over 100 friends and family, he
	had champagne, his first drink of liquor in his life, after
	promising his mother he wouldn't drink until he was 100. Several
	days later, he died in the Providence Alaska Medical Center in
	Anchorage at around 10:30 AM on December 23, 2005. His wife and
	some close friends were with him.
